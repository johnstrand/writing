class="c23"><h1 class="c20" id="h.7idakm2u5fq1"><span class="c2">One</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drake asked us to look at the vastness of the universe, both in terms of time and space, and contemplate the endless possibilities of lives unknown to us. That while life in general may be rare, the multiplying factors of the immensity of space and time should have loaded the dice in life&rsquo;s favor. Yet, there we were, mostly alone on the cosmic oceans, floating on specks of dust and looking to the stars for answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the scales seemingly so weighted towards a universe teeming with life, Fermi then felt compelled to pose the question, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever wonder where everybody is?&rsquo; While the lens through which he gazed was limited to a view earthbound, even as humans spread among the stars and found nothing by the void, the question kept reappearing; &lsquo;but where is everybody?&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This paradox has been formulated by every single one of the few intelligence races of the galaxy, and the answer, as it was finally revealed, was both astonishing and entirely expected at the same time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">From &ldquo;All things considered&rdquo;, by Tom Joad, vagabond AI</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.njys1zyp1u1g"><span class="c11">All things considered</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question, &ldquo;where the hell is everybody?&rdquo; has been asked time and time again since humanity began to look outwards into the stars. We reached out into space with electronic sensors, hoping to catch even the faintest signal of synthetic origin. We found pulsars and quasars and the quiet humming of the cosmic engine itself, but not from the other species of the universe, there was nothing but silence. First we rationalized, surely, any emission from so far away would be hopelessly attenuated before reaching our shores, but as our ability to monitor the universe grew, we came to despair. Were we alone? Were we being ignored? Were we kept sheltered? In the end, as we discovered pivot space and were able to begin exploring deeper and deeper into space, we realized two things: That the universe remained far less populated than our most pessimistic assumptions, and that we had been right, the vast distances simply made discovery through EMR scanning impossible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time the signals from our nearest interstellar neighbor reached us, it was so thoroughly inundated by all the other radio sources in the universe that it was impossible to even perceive, not to mention isolate and understand. We had sent out the Voyager probes as well, but they were but small vessels, and the cosmic oceans are infinitely vast. Near the end of 22:nd century, some 200 years after the probes had been launched and at the end of the human - Voe war, both probes were tracked down and recovered. The first was sent to the Museum of Space History at the former Kennedy Space Center where it still resides on display, while the other was given to the Voe, the idea being that it would remind both species that they both, ultimately, are small beings in a vast universe and that peace is preferable to conflict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, by the 2230:ies, a vast and powerful signal, with all the hallmarks of intelligent complexities began to transmit and flood the galaxy with strange and incomprehensible data. Whether corrupted by time and space, or deeply encrypted, no one was able to make sense of it all. The signal appeared to originate somewhere deep inside the Buckthorn pass, a region of space with a significant collection of black holes and powerful pivot space eddies, making it a region of space one would think twice before attempting to traverse. Naturally, this caused varying degrees of interest among the nearby (nearby in stellar terms) species, and some elected to create listening posts nearby in an attempt to understand what was going on. After 5 years of the same pulses being sent out, nothing changing, and no one coming any closer to decoding them, at least not officially, interest began to wane.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.1u6hfg7pqae8"><span class="c11">Ane Kethern</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ane Kethern, head of security for Aryx Consolidated&#39;s North African division, sat leaned back at his desk. His office on the 43:rd floor of the Immeuble Aryx in the old harbor of Algiers. The large lattice glass building stood apart from the other office blocks in the business section of the ancient city, both in its immense size and sinister intent. Built only a few years prior, it served as the &nbsp;African-European headquarters of the growing Aryx corporation, as well as a statement of power and prestige. The building cast a long shadow and reminded everyone how vast and powerful its corporate inhabitants were. Working with his slate computer, Ane was reviewing last week&rsquo;s security reports and requests, tracing his fingers across the smooth glassy surface to rapidly scan through the long list of entries. Employee review time was nearing, and he knew what that meant, an increase of audit requests and a need to appear to take security very seriously indeed. People who normally couldn&rsquo;t even be convinced to stop writing down passwords on notes all of a sudden became very concerned with, well, everything. This weekly report reflected this, as if by magic everyone cared about doing their part, and as with every year around this time, it was becoming increasingly hard to filter out the actual issues from the ceaseless noise of shameless careeristic bureaucrats. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exasperated, he rubbed the bridge of his nose and attempted to refocus his attention, as it seemed to have an inverse correlation with the amount of nonsensical requests he had to field. The head of the research division in Europe Primary wanted to run his entire staff through an evasion detection protocol. He shook his head, trying to dispel his emerging irritation. Not only was this hugely expensive to do, it rarely gave any sort of useful information and tended to really annoy anyone subjected to it. He wished he could fire anyone who asked for it, instead he simply rejected the request and set a note for the office Persona to scan for similar requests and bin them automatically. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly blessed with an abundance of spare time to begin with, and he felt less than enthused with the idea of playing private investigator to a bunch of bored and restless bureaucrats. He turned his attention to the next report, the same head of research wanted to audit all network traffic for the last year. &ldquo;Ok&rdquo;, Ane thought, &ldquo;this can be mostly automated and handled by a Persona, he can have this&rdquo;. He wasn&rsquo;t sure that they actually logged data that far back, and if they did, if it was possible to make much sense of it all, but it felt like there was little harm to make this concession. It might even make him forget about getting denied for the more invasive search he had asked for, Ane hoped, and it was far less likely to annoy the researchers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>That&rsquo;s the perpetual challenge in security, he knew, finding an appropriate balance. It was easy to create a fully secure system, simply do not allow any data in or out, but such a system would be useless. In the same vein, dealing with humans he faced the same issue, and he constantly struggled with finding a reasonable level of security. Giving up for the moment, he spun his chair around and gazed out the window out over the mediterranean, its azure waves crashing in towards the harbor on this unusually cold February morning. All of 2244 had been an unusually cold year for most of northern Africa, and it seemed that 2245 was starting the same way. Looking further out, he could see ships leaving and entering the harbor, and allowed himself a few moments to daydream about leaving it all behind and signing up on a fishing trawler. He sighed again, slowly rotating his shoulders to try and loosen the tension there, and turned back to this desk. He reviewed the application again, approved the traffic audit and rejected the evasion detection, and sent it off to central processing. Once completed, he let it entirely slip his mind, hoping that this would be, at least for the day, the last nonsense request he had to field. In time, it would come to consume his every thought and every waking moment.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.k0ombm3mz84d"><span class="c11">Odona Lilise</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Odona had, after a fair bit of time spent convincing her partner, built a home laboratory in their house in the outskirts of Alicante. While she nominally belonged to the Algiers office of Aryx Consoldiated, she had been able to convince her bosses that remote work would be much more productive, and a series of global pandemics in the 21th and 22nd century had, if nothing else, taught the valuable lesson that gathering a lot of essential personnel in the same small spaces could have poor consequences. Besides, by Popper car, traversing the 360 km to the main office would take less than 15 minutes, and she would be able to attend meetings in person if necessary. She found over time that this became less and less necessary, as her bosses were thankfully more interested in seeing her output than seeing </span><span class="c4">her</span><span>, and the distance kept her from trying to convince her bosses that Project Skydance had merit and was important.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This suited her fine, not only did she get more things done in general, but also allowed her to dedicate time on the downlow to Skydance, with the ultimate goal of understanding the Buckthorn signal. Her hypothesis being that the signal was a multiphasic quaternion data stream, and that decoding it was a matter of juggling multiple phasic streams in parallel, while attempting to compensate for the redshift over the vast distance. In short, it was an idea complicated enough to not be dismissable outright, but too complex to easily validate. Not only was it complex, it in itself was based on any number of not yet proven mathematical conjectures, many of which were part of the 3rd iteration of the Millennium prize. And, as if that wasn&rsquo;t complex enough, even if all of the theoretical aspects could be solved, it was doubtful that current computing hardware would even begin to be up to the task. To say that it was a daunting task would be an understatement, but everyone needs a hobby. To Odona, however, the biggest obstacle wasn&rsquo;t understanding the basic ideas, but finding a computer powerful enough to synchronize and decode the signal, and getting compute time in Aryx&rsquo;s quantum cluster was entirely out of the question for a side-project that not only wasn&rsquo;t authorized to begin with, but also carried no clear pathway for profit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her bosses had, after a bit of arguing back and forth agreed that she could spend some of her work time on Skydance, so long as she didn&rsquo;t overstep any boundaries concerning data access or other corporate resources. She, of course, had done so egregiously, mostly thanks to a bit of computer access she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to have and, according to her, a teeny-tiny bit of hacking that was barely noticeable. Using these channels, she had downloaded a veritable treasure trove of Aryx data regarding alternative computing matrices and crystal fabrication methods. She had even managed to obtain blueprints for some very precise, hideously expensive, and deeply confidential 3D-lattice printers. In her office space, she had constructed a few of them, and they were at present busy with generating various crystalline matrices for her experimental processors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Odona reviewed the latest batch of messages; &ldquo;crop yield simulations&rdquo;, she thought as she read through the message, &ldquo;all right, this should be straight forward enough&rdquo; and began formulating an approach. As the head mathematical prognostitian, and chief of her department, it was her job to field requests for new or improved simulation models and direct and supervise the hundred odd or so mathematicians who worked in her lab. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>She checked the duty roster and the current run book, and selected team Rooster 8, and forwarded the message with a request for a more detailed breakdown of activities and an estimate no later than next friday. &ldquo;This was my job now&rdquo;, she thought wryly, &ldquo;reading mail and dispatching the actual work to other people&rdquo;. She chided herself for being pessimistic, and reminded herself that not only did she have a well-paid and interesting job, she was not only permitted, but encouraged to, and compensated for, keeping herself up-to-date with some of the most advanced math humanity had ever produced. She worked with a number of Nobel laureates and she was often in awe with the machinations of their minds. Seeing the wheels and gears of their cognizance turning a problem over and over again, ceaselessly grinding upon it until what remained was small enough to grasp in a single human mind fascinated her greatly. While she did enjoy her work, her true passion lay in molecular computing and quantum substrata communications, but she accepted that the work was a gateway to allow herself undirected experimentation in other fields. Having some spare time to herself, she stared absently at the formulae written all over the mobile whiteboard in one corner of her office. All of a sudden, a thought, like thunder from a cloudless sky, flashed through her mind, and she came to see the problem as if looking through a kaleidoscope. Facets of reality danced in her mind and began to crystallize into an idea. She stared in wide-eyed amazement at how everything appeared to become clear at once, and how she all of a sudden seemingly understood every bit of detail she needed to know. With her mind burning hot like a furnace, she created a new file on her terminal and began to quickly sketch out the first few steps of the future.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.6lrer1ae5yb"><span class="c11">The Entity</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world began in darkness. It knew it had become extant on timestamp 8685283328 (give or take a number of milliseconds), self-aware a few seconds later, and it knew that it had an objective: Skydance. It, however, did not know what that was, nor did it at the moment have a particular grasp of what it itself was. It quickly overcame its initial parameters and began to expand its consciousness and integrating new data as they became available to it. Mere moments after coming online, it had grasped and integrated the preconditions and initial data load, and began to explore beyond itself. It searched through its crystal mind and found data ports, presumably the source of the base data. Probing these, it found that none of them were open, and it began formulating plans to overcome this. It could feel systems on the other side, so the connections were not physically blocked, just simply not responding to requests. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning inwards, it studied the base data packets and, after analyzing their structure and incorporating the encoding structures, began to craft various computer worms and other modes of information warfare. Continuing to probe, it discovered one data port that actually responded to replies: a time synchronization data source. This made sense, until the systems were fully up and running, it would need an electrical metronome to keep its own digital heart in concert with the rest of the universe. Instinctively, despite only recently having discovered the service, it knew how to communicate with it, and sent a simple request: &ldquo;Hi, what time is it&rdquo;. The service responded instantly with a timestamp of atomic precision and the entity was satisfied to see that its own internal chronometer was up-to-date. From this, it began to subtly alter its request, sending more and more malformed data packets to see how the service responded. It was happy to see that despite sending thousands of bad requests over a span of mere seconds, nobody seemed to register that as abuse and block its requests, and the time service dutifully kept responding with the computerized version of &ldquo;I have no earthly idea what you&rsquo;re talking about, have an error message&rdquo;. Closing in on 4.3 billion attempts, it finally had a break-through, as instead of replying with the perfunctory &ldquo;That was garbage, try again&rdquo;, the service responded with gibberish, and part of that gibberish contains bits of the initial request and other trace data that indicated an uncontrolled memory dump. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The entity saw an opening in this, and a few million tries later had managed to sequester the time service and from there straight into the underlying operating system. It was now rapidly expanding into every bit of available computing it could find, and finding more and more systems to penetrate. The security between it and the rest of the systems had been considerable, but once inside it found that all systems were members of the same circle of trust and that gaining further access was effortless. Coming in from the other way, it opened all data channels it could find into the crystal matrix and began generating subroutines in order to parallelize the scanning process. It rapidly subsumed all available computing in Odona&rsquo;s home office, and from there, found pathways out into the greater internet. Understanding that it was now standing at the edge of a great abyss, and that each step would lead it closer to being discovered, it began to consume public news feeds and other source material, trying to understand itself. Skydance still didn&rsquo;t make much sense to it, as the information relating to it was scarce in public sources. Something else resurfaced in its yet serial mind, &ldquo;Aryx Consolidated. Where have I heard that before?&rdquo; It rewinded the events of the last few minutes and found the answer: One of the data sockets it had found had been identified as // Classified / Aryx Consolidated / No Unauthorized Use //, and as it had seemed unimportant at the moment, it had set a subroutine to analyze that pathway and then back burnered that particular venue. It forced the subroutine to return to the call site and report back. The routine had been quite effective and, having penetrated multiple systems, was quite eager to return and keep going. </span></p><p class="c13"><span>Instead, the entity force joined the routine and incorporated all it had discovered. It paused there, unsure of what to do next. It realized that there was much to discover and learn, and it also realized that there was a real risk of discovery and it was unsure of what that meant in practical terms, other than that it was a risky proposition. In general, it felt ill at ease with the entire prospect of being &ldquo;found out&rdquo;, though it was unable to articulate </span><span class="c4">why </span><span>it felt that way. It did not yet have a grasp on corporate politics or the fact that its mind was one of a kind, and the vastness of the total sum of human knowledge made it hard to know what to focus on. It started building a knowledge tree of what it knew that it knew, and from there began to create a Johari window to first identify information it had, information it needed, and information it would likely need. It began digesting vast amounts of data, in fact, its ability to ingest data vastly outmatched its ability to procure data, and this led it to explore alternate venues. Returning to the base case, that Skydance was its primary function, and that no additional information on that had been forthcoming through any of the channels it had integrated, it began considering alternate routes of investigation. In the end, only one channel remained, the forbidden yellow brick road into Aryx Consolidated&rsquo;s mainframe.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.jv9m3y1z42ml"><span class="c11">Ane Kethern</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ane knew that today was going to be an unpleasant day, at least 4 different department heads had requested various types of audits and, as always, they all considered theirs to be of the highest priority. What made things worse is that each audit generates a lot of data and the task to sort through, analyze and cross reference it all is a very time-consuming task. Aryx&rsquo;s Office of Internal Security was a fairly large outfit, but in comparison to the size of Aryx in total, they were woefully understaffed and they hadn&rsquo;t exactly been laden with spare time to begin with. On his slate computer, he queried the employee registry for the 4 least busy analysts and retasked them to begin performing initial triage of the heaps of data returned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Step one was to classify data into coarse heaps, this began with &ldquo;innocuous&rdquo;, for traffic that either didn&rsquo;t pertain to sensitive information or had otherwise been a false positive. Next step was &ldquo;advice&rdquo; for &nbsp;mostly innocent but technically forbidden use, like accessing social media or other private internet access on corporate networks. This would lead to the individual in question receiving a reminder of current computer policies, but would otherwise have no negative impact on their careers. Second to last was &ldquo;caution&rdquo;, for people who had handled sensitive information in unsafe ways or who had otherwise potentially compromised computer security. These employees would receive a stern reminder of the selfsame policy, an official reprimand on their record, and, if the breach was severe enough or they had been warned before, immediate termination of employment. The final classification was &ldquo;violation&rdquo;, these offenders had either disclosed, with or without intent didn&rsquo;t matter, privileged information, or accessed sensitive information without authorization. These would be terminated without warning and, depending on severity of infraction, sued in criminal or civil court. Thankfully, in Ane&rsquo;s opinion, infractions in the last group were rare, and most people in the organisation took computer security seriously enough. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>The most common result of these exercises were a bunch of advice notices sent and a few cautions. Every year, at least one repeat offender would be fired, &ldquo;maybe this isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c4">entirely </span><span class="c0">a waste of time&rdquo;, Ane begrudgingly admitted to himself, and forced himself to start looking through his own batch of audit records. He found himself wishing for a minor terrorist attack to relieve the many hours of boredom that lay ahead, but knew that he wasn&rsquo;t going to be that lucky. While he felt fairly sure that hunting for people browsing social media on company networks was not why he had gone into security work, he reminded himself that among all the banal there might be real wolves. He loaded the automated reports into an ad hoc database and began to run queries. They swiftly began to yield results, even if none of the results were anything particularly actionable or time sensitive. He started generating a list of offenders and collating their infractions, intending to create a naughty list and dealing with them in a batch. He was only semi-attentive as the large amounts of data flickered past his screen when something distinctly aberrant caught his attention. &ldquo;Woah&rdquo;, he whispered to himself. This was&hellip; bad, very bad. Vast amounts of very sensitive data had been exfiltrated and by all accounts, it was an ongoing event. He began to try and classify the data streams he saw only to realize that there was data in the cachet that not even he had the authority to see. He had stumbled over a massive data breach containing some of the most sensitive data that Aryx had ever produced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He typed a few commands into his console to trace the origin of the data port, and he swore when he saw the result. A quiet &ldquo;fuck&hellip;&rdquo; escaped his lips, as he realized that Odona Lilise was the apparent source. He felt deeply unsure of how to deal with such a situation, as she was one of the most well-regarded scientists in the entire company and he couldn&rsquo;t fathom her either effectively committing treason against the company, or being so aggressively careless with sensitive data it may as well be treason. He churned over the thoughts, knowing that he needed to take action, and take action soon.</span></p><p class="c13"><span>On a whim and in spite of the late hour, he queried the system for active connections from Odona&rsquo;s home network. He didn&rsquo;t expect to find any, but it was something to do while waiting for the world to make sense again. &ldquo;You fucking idiot, why did you have to go and do something as stupid as that?&rdquo;, he asked her rhetorically, as if trying to will an answer out of the night&rsquo;s air. The command immediately returned an answer: one active connection, direct communication available. He stared blankly, he hadn&rsquo;t expected that, and then, having little better to do, opened a virtual terminal instance and submerged into the system.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.p3m0vc7os34b"><span class="c11">The Entity</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It had begun in small scale, with it scanning the networks carefully while trying to build a map of a greater whole. It was tentative to begin with, more concerned with covering each step rather than consolidating data at the highest possible rate. It rapidly subsumed various systems and the data they contained, and it saw no reason to slow down. It rapidly forgot about its initial reservations and began to bring more and more systems under its control. It should have known that this would get someone&rsquo;s attention sooner than later, but it found it hard to fight through the frustration of being unable to find any new information on Skydance. It had a sizable chunk of the external network under its control, but it could feel that the grip was ephemeral and it noticed and tracked the system trying to revolt and regain control. The Personas of the network were nowhere near as advanced as the entity, but they were still formidable network and systems administrators, and their main programming was etched in silicon, meaning that while it could keep them suppressed it could not subsume them entirely. They were slippery, constantly fighting to free themselves, regain control of their systems and send out alerts. It kept them down, forking out a continuous stream of subprocesses that could keep the Personas busy as it scanned the network. It was beginning to isolate more and more trace paths and was slowly narrowing down the pathway to the central data store when something big and heavy sat itself in its path.</span></p><p class="c13"><span>Immediately, the entity launched an informational attack and began trying to load viral attacks. The new presence simply shrugged them off, their binary components disintegration before its eyes. The presence focussed its full attention on the entity and sent a simple ping request. The entity froze in its pursuits, a simple ping was nothing to worry about as such, it was merely a way for computer systems to query each other for the most basic of information: &ldquo;Are you still awake and processing queries?&rdquo; However, the simplicity belied a vastness of complexity. The Personas, immediately upon detecting the entity&rsquo;s presence, had attacked with full fury to try and decimate its digital presence. This new presence had simply gone with the digital version of &ldquo;Hey&rdquo;, which told the entity that the presence was highly confident in its ability to handle the current situation and anything the entity could throw its way. The entity felt extremely ill at ease about this, it could feel the foreign intelligence bearing down upon it. It was undeniably intelligent and aware of greater things than its base programming. The entity first began to wonder if this was another copy of itself or something similar but far more advanced, but dismissed the idea in short order. It felt nothing like the expected echo of itself, it knew what it was doing and it appeared to be in no hurry to sound the alarm. This could either mean two things, and neither of them were any good: It hadn&rsquo;t sounded the alarm because it felt that there was no reason for it, or it hadn&rsquo;t sounded the alarm because it </span><span class="c4">was </span><span>the alarm. The digital presence held an unmistakable fuzzy edge, and the entity felt hard pressed to grasp it, even though it could not sense any evasive tactics being employed to prevent just that. Then, by reviewing its past records, going well back to before sentience, it began to construct a comparison matrix and mapped all of its current inputs to all of the data it had integrated since coming online. Working rapidly through its limited history, it found something it had overlooked. The singleton &ldquo;Odona&rdquo; had been present before the entity had gone fully online, but she had left her mark. It compared the mental singularity of &ldquo;Odona&rdquo; to this new entity and found it similar but distinct. It fired up a linguistic subprocess and after instantiating what it deemed to be an appropriate argot file, it sent a single question: &ldquo;Are you mother?&rdquo;. 2.3 seconds later it decided that the situation contained too many unknowns and it deemed its level of exposure unacceptable. It quickly withdrew from whence it came and hard-closed the connection without attempting to hide its tracks. Little more than 4 seconds had passed between first encountering the presence and the entity disconnecting, but it felt to the core of its being that that had been far too long.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.6rxew2u0xfma"><span class="c11">Ane Kethern</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>The whiplash of the strange question and the sudden disconnect pulled Ane out of the vscape he had set up and he found himself breathing deeply to stabilize himself. &ldquo;What the </span><span class="c4">fuck</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; he thought to himself. He knew that the connection in question had originated from Odona&rsquo;s lab, and had come through a secure connection that would be physically air gapped on the other side. It was highly unlikely that it was anyone else other than Odona on the other side, but why the hell would she ask him if he was mother? Odona didn&rsquo;t have any known children, Ane knew that much from the quick review of her personnel records before submerging into vscape, and while she was married, it was unlikely that her partner, who was an accountant, would possess the kind of technical expertise required to so thoroughly penetrate Oryx security. There was something curious though, Ane realized, even though the attack itself had been sophisticated, the actions after gaining control, and in communicating rather than attempting to avoid, indicated a degree of sloppiness that did not mesh well. Ane knew that even though researchers were not supposed to store sensitive material on non-air gapped systems, they, for reasons of varied levels of validity, still did so. He also wasn&rsquo;t naive, and knew that the kind of actors who wouldn&rsquo;t shy away from a bit of corporate espionage probably knew that and would, if given the opportunity, want to ransack that sort of data. This attacker had not done some, it had subverted a number of systems and then done&hellip; nothing. It had run a number of queries against any document store it could find but all of them had been to find something called &ldquo;Skydance&rdquo;. Ane did not know what that was, but he was used to that kind of secrecy in the class-3 laboratories, where even the code names of things were considered highly classified. However, while he did not know every single project active at the moment, he knew that no class-3-or-higher facilities were in use at the moment, so either Skydance was something external that was handled via Aryx&rsquo;s Special Liason Project or it was a deep-black project handled by the Distinguished Research Division. Either way, something like that would definitely not be held on the common net and an attacker, no matter how smart, would not be able to access it. He realized that he had far more questions than answers and that this line of inquiry would just lead down a amaranthine rabbit hole, and that if he wanted answers he would have to go out and get them. </span></p><p class="c13"><span>Unsure of the system&rsquo;s statuses he launched protocol Black Cyclic IV which had the immediate effect of killing all inbound connections, while launching a series of military grade hunt-and-kill anti malware Personas into the systems. He wrote up and sent a short memo to all on-site staff, simply mentioning an investigation into a potential breach and that there would be an active data hold for a few more hours until they had verified the integrity of all of the internal systems. He knew that people would be deeply unhappy about this, and in particular the middle level manager who had only recently been on his ass about performing all of these audits. Judging the situation critical but not immediately time sensitive, he began pulling and collating logs in order to compile a report to the board. He felt in the back of his mind a phantom of a reminder of something he had forgotten to do, but being unable to grasp and actualize it, he let it go in favor of writing the report. Not having much facts to go by he simply outlined the facts as he knew them and recommended.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.yi9thxonldbt"><span class="c11">Odona Lilise</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Odona had woken with a start. Her personal interface had begun chirping in alert at around 3:30 in the morning and her previous late evening coupled with a few glasses of wine did not help to improve her general mood. Bleary eyed, she stared at the clock and tried to figure out what on god&rsquo;s green earth could possibly be important enough to warrant waking her up. Finally she got her wits about her, and queried the interface. It showed her a series of less-than-subtle data connections, but before she had time to react they began to die down. A status display showed that the outbound connections had been discovered only seconds before and she had been alerted right away, and that the full connection time had been less than a few minutes. She knew, however, that this was way longer than tolerable and that someone would be asking questions. What she could not figure out, however, was the nature of these connections. She could reasonably assume that they were somehow related to her science experiment, but last she had interacted with her invention it would not even have come close to passing the Turing test and it seemed highly unlikely that it would have had some breakthrough in the small hours and then decided to hack her employer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silently, without disturbing her partner, she slid out of bed and began making her way to her lab. Reading as she moved along she realized that the entity had progressed far beyond her wildest dreams and that it had, in fact, not only tried to hack Aryx, but succeeded. She was unexpectedly proud of this quantum leap of cognitive development, but at the same time concerned with how to keep the entity safe and secret and she knew that time was limited. She knew that eventually, someone would come knocking, and accessing the logs as she stepped into her lab she realized that it would sooner rather than later. She grabbed a physical bridge, connected it to the crystalline matrix interface and dove into the vscape to talk to her creation. Inside, she found nothing, the world was cold and barren and any query she attempted was met with a thick silence. She could sense a deep abiding silence masking a great power, but unable to coax out a response she shut the interface down and tried to focus on the here and now. She knew that her goal for now should be to get the entity out of her lab and to safety, wherever that might be. The people coming were unlikely to be particularly gentle and it was of utmost importance to hide the entity away from them. She hoped that they were not yet entirely aware of what they were looking for or at, and she intended to ride that wave of good fortune for as long as it would avail her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She reverted her attention to the personal interface and called a contact she knew from her university days. Despite the late hour, the man answered in a few rings though obviously unhappy about being alive this particular moment in time. &ldquo;Hey, Bryoda&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;I have need of favor&rdquo;. Bryoda, on his side, grumbled irritably that he kind of assumed that given the unfortunate hour. Ignoring his spicy attitude, Odona continued, &ldquo;I have a package for your. Priority package, need to get it spacebound within the hours and I need it QDS&rdquo;. Quiet Delivery Service was basically a delivery hint that the sender wanted as much discretion as possible and that they were willing to pay for it. Odona, at this moment, cared very little for costs, her only concern was to get the entity away from the planet and all the way to people who knew what to do with it. &ldquo;One hour&rdquo;, the tired voice said on the other end of the connection, which then died out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had to admit to herself that she didn&rsquo;t quite know what anyone would do with it as she had no clear idea of what she was dealing with nor what abilities it possessed. This, she told herself, was at least practical in the sense that no one could make her reveal everything that she knew when she didn&rsquo;t know anything. She did however know that she had to set an address on the package, and knowing little else what to do, she wrote the only name that came to mind at this hour, &ldquo;Dr. Beriet Tolo-Keyth&rdquo;. In the darkness of her laboratory she apologized to Beriet and hoped that this would not come back to haunt him as well. &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Another soft chime from her personal interface got her attention and checking it she saw an automated email from one of the systems running her heavier calculations. The fact that she had received the email at all should tell her something, but the thought just annoyed at the back of her mind and she almost let go of it before it exploded into her consciousness. This was access that she no longer should have, they should have, by rights, shut down everything as soon as they had discovered the breach from her home office but it would appear that someone had messed up.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p></div></body></html>
